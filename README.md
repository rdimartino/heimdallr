# Heimdallr

The watchmen of the gods, Heimdallr sounds the mighty horn, Gjallarhorn, to announce the onset of Ragnar√∂k.

This is a little Twitterbot that watches for updates to the [538 Presidential Election Forecast](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/), and announces the candidates' chances of victory on Twitter everytime the forecast is updated.

This project was written for Python 2.7 and has two dependencies: [twitter](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/twitter) and [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/).  The bot also uses [Single-user OAuth](https://dev.twitter.com/oauth/overview/single-user) for posting to Twitter.

I've also included a .conf file for an Ubuntu upstart script.
